In this project, I gained valuable experience in web scraping, file downloads, and data processing. Here's  summary of my key contributions. I learned to use Selenium for automating web tasks, extracting information.Managed file downloads using both system commands and Selenium. Executed external processes in Python . Organized code into functions for clarity and ease of management. Collaborated effectively with team members for seamless integration. Implemented features like automatic downloads and streamlined searches for user-friendly functionality, researched Exploit-DB website requirements, mastered XPath queries, processed and stored extracted data for generating PDF reports.
Gained experience in addressing potential issues and providing clear error messages for debugging.

Overall, this project significantly advanced my skills in web automation and interaction, benefiting my development expertise. It emphasized collaboration, modular design, and effective problem-solving. My proficiency with Selenium extends to various domains beyond this project, showcasing versatile capabilities. In our group there are me - Elvin, Mrs. Raqsana, Mr. Husein and Mr. Tural. They are so kind, smart, hardworking, team-friendly, team members with very high personal qualities. Hussain and I are quite advanced in writing the code. I think that what I have learned thanks to this project will help us a lot in our career path and will always remain in our memory. In addition, due to Mr. Tural's interest in this Red Team, he directly took over the research and testing phase of the project. Tural and Raqsana interested every day with whether the code is ready, they clarified the codes we wrote line by line. I learned a lot from this team and would love to work with them again. Along with that, I was doing internet discussion, research in class about code related problems, finding and asking Linkedin back end developers.
