Personal Contributions:

I was playing critical role throughout this project's development, participating in significant ways. The followings are my contributions:

Code Development:

I was responsible for developing the core functionality of the project, including the web scraping script (NVD Data Scraper) and the PDF generation functionality.
My coding efforts made it possible for us to quickly and effectively fetch CVE data from the NVD website and produce organized PDF reports.

Integration of Selenium:

To enable automatic interaction with web pages, I imported Selenium into the project. This was important while downloading and looking for exploits on the Exploit-DB website.

Team Collaboration:

I actively collaborated with team members by sharing knowledge and insights about web scraping, Selenium automation, and PDF generation.
I provided guidance and support to team members when they encountered technical challenges related to their assigned tasks.

Lessons Learned:

Working on this project has been a valuable learning experience for me. Some of the key lessons I've gained include:

Web Scraping Proficiency:

I gained a deeper understanding of online scraping methods, such as using BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and visiting websites to collect particular data.

Selenium Automation:

Integrating Selenium for web automation was a new challenge. I learned how to automate web interactions effectively.

Project Collaboration:

Collaborating within a project team taught me the importance of clear communication, coordination, and knowledge sharing.
I enhanced my teamwork and problem-solving skills by working together with colleagues who brought diverse expertise to the project.

Project Management:

I gained insights into project management practices, including version control, issue tracking, and collaborative development using Git and GitHub.

Team Collaboration:

Collaborating with my team members was a rewarding experience. We leveraged each other's strengths to address various aspects of the project. Code reviews, and shared knowledge helped us overcome challenges and deliver a functional solution.

I appreciate the contributions of my fellow team members, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to work together on this project. Our collective effort and collaboration have resulted in a project that we can be proud of.
