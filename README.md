# CVE-Report


## Description

This Python project is designed to retrieve information about Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and generate a PDF document containing detailed information about a specified CVE. It also has the capability to search for and download related exploits from the Exploit-DB website. The project comprises two Python scripts:

NVD Data Scraper (First Script):

Fetches information about a specific CVE from the NVD website.
Generates a PDF report containing details such as CVE ID, publication date, CVSS score, CVSS vector, description, related hyperlinks, affected software versions, and any available exploits.
Utilizes libraries like Requests, BeautifulSoup, and ReportLab.
Exploit-DB Search and Download (Second Script):

Uses Selenium with Chrome WebDriver to search for exploits related to a specified CVE on the Exploit-DB website.
Downloads any available exploits and stores them on the user's system.
Requires Chrome WebDriver and handles the download process using Chrome.
Imports the ExportPdf function from the first script to generate a PDF report.

## Dependencies

- Python (version 3.11.4)
- Selenium (version 4.12.0)
- BeautifulSoup4 (version 4.12.2)
- ReportLab (version 4.0.4)

## Instructions for Running the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the second script *main.py*, providing the desired CVE ID as input. 
    This script will:
        * Search for exploits related to the CVE on Exploit-DB.
        * Generate a PDF report using the ExportPdf function from the first script.
        * Download the PDF report using a web browser.
